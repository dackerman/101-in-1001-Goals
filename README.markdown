101 Goals in 1001 Days webapp
=============================
This app is a quick and easy way to record your goals for the [101 goals in 1001 days](http://101goalsin1001days.com/) project.  You go to [goals/](http://localhost/goals/) to see your goals in a list, where you can add them.  Once they are added, you can click through to view the goal, which allows you to add an arbitrary number of tasks.  

Task Status
___________
You can mark tasks "current", which means they are actionable now.  These tasks will show up in a big list at [tasks/](http://localhost/tasks/).  Once you are done with a task, you can click the checkbox at[tasks/](http://localhost/tasks/) or go into the goals page to mark it complete.  A task will only show up in the [tasks/](http://localhost/tasks/) page if it is both current and not complete.
